# Information-theoretic Security
A cryptosystem is considered to have **information-theoretic security (unconditional security)** if the system is secure against adversaries with unlimited computing resources and time.[^wiki]

One-time pad is the only cryptosystem having unconditional security.

In contrast, a system which depends on the computational cost of cryptanalysis to be secure (and thus can be broken by an attack with unlimited computation) is called **computationally secure (conditionally secure)**.[^wiki]
