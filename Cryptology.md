## Libraries
C++:
- [AWS-LC: A general-purpose cryptographic library maintained by the AWS Cryptography team for AWS and their customers. It Ñ–s based on code from the Google BoringSSL project and the OpenSSL project.](https://github.com/aws/aws-lc)
  - [BUILDING.md](https://github.com/aws/aws-lc/blob/main/BUILDING.md)
    - CMake, Perl, Go, NASM
    - No vcpkg
- [Botan: Crypto and TLS for Modern C++](https://github.com/randombit/botan)

Rust:
- [Rust Crypto](https://github.com/RustCrypto)

- [aws-lc-rs: A cryptographic library using AWS-LC for its cryptographic operations. The library strives to be API-compatible with the popular Rust library named ring.](https://github.com/aws/aws-lc-rs)
