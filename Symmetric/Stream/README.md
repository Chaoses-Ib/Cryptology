> Public key encryption is not a block cipher in the standard definition of the term (a [pseudorandom permutation family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_permutation)), nor under that of a stream cipher (an encryption scheme that XORs the messages with the output of a pseudorandom generator seeded with a random, shared secret key).

> I think you're asking this out of some form of the common preconception that the concepts "block cipher" and "stream cipher" are general taxonomy of ciphers, two buckets into which we generally sort all objects that are suitable for use as ciphers. But they're not so; "block cipher" and "stream cipher" are two fairly narrow types of object that have simply been of great interest to modern cryptographers. There are designs that are based on different, less well-known concepts, e.g. the concept of an *enciphering schemes* that serves as the foundation for [AEZ](http://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/aez/), one of the current candidates in the CAESAR competition.
